    <div class="section quote">
      In the works of Reinier van Duijn the autonomous self takes the centre stage. Various experiences shaped Van Duijn to become sceptic towards the mechanisms of systems and institutions. For this reason his work is set to move outside of the systemics of art itself; always working to contain the artist’s freedom. By using a wide range of unorthodox and unusual materials that appear at first glance to be rejected, Van Duijn shows his rebellious attitude. But while he appears to constantly look to stir things up, he also utilises humour to keep his work light and self-reflective.

By bringing his works together in room-filling installations not short of being chaotic, the artist brings his desire to keep things fluid into the space. And where his audience is allowed to marvel itself over the wide variety of materials and objects, it should also be on the outlook as anything could change at any moment.
